# CodeWars-Practice

this is the space where I keep my answers to problems I have solved for codewors, and where I will also keep notes of where I have improved the code, as there are often many different ways to reach an answer.

I may have my initial answer or edited answer only, or I might have both to show my progress and alternative ways that I enjoyed learning about or using.
